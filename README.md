## Note Taking Web Application

JJA notes is a simple and easy to use note taking app that allows users to store Notebooks and Pages in one central location.

## Collaborators

[Josh Luo](https://github.com/MnRxi6f8JN),
[Jiakai Ren](https://github.com/jiakairen) and
[Alex Nicolaidis](https://github.com/Anico94)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Languages and Frameworks

- Javascript, HTML, CSS/SCSS
- Frontend build with React
- Firebase Firestore used as the Database
- Tiny MCE https://www.tiny.cloud/ (used for the rich text editor)
- MUI Core used for styling https://mui.com/core/

## Deployment

Application has been deployed with firebase and can be found at https://jja-notes.firebaseapp.com/

## Future Plans

- Profile page will allow users to add collaborators
- These collaborators will be able to share notebooks and pages
- The editor will update the database without the user having to save the document
- Add close and open drag tabs to the notebooks and pages so that the user can have the full page for the notes.
- Allow user to reorder the notebooks and pages.
- Add search functionality

## Known Issues

- Clicking on the same notebook requires a double click to hide the pages tabs
- Heading above the page editor doesn't change when the notebook name is edited. This still requires fixing.
- Page and Notebook ordering is base on unique identifiers not base on how the user would like them ordered.
- search field does not work
