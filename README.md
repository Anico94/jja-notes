## Deployment

Application has been deployed with firebase and can be found at https://jja-notes.firebaseapp.com/

## Future Plans

- Profile page will allow users to add collaborators
- These collaborators will be able to share notebooks and pages
- The editor will update the database without the user having to save the document
- Add close and open drag tabs to the notebooks and pages so that the user can have the full page for the notes.
- Allow user to reorder the notebooks and pages.
- Add search functionality

## Known Issues

- Clicking on the same notebook requires a double click to hide the pages tabs
- Heading above the page editor doesn't change when the notebook name is edited. This still requires fixing.
- Page and Notebook ordering is base on unique identifiers not base on how the user would like them ordered.
- search field does not work
